The IEEE Egypt Section SSCS Chapter is holding a student design competition in
the summer of 2024. This contest asks students to design a low-dropout
regulator (LDO) with the specs given below. The operation of the circuit should
be demonstrated by a report that includes the simulation results of all the specs
and the transient response FOMT
